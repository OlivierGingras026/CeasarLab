# CeasarLab1

A simple C# console application that demonstrates the **Caesar cipher** (shift cipher).  
It includes basic file input/output helpers and sample text files (an encrypted snippet and a large plaintext).

## Features
- Encode/decode text using a configurable shift (Caesar cipher)
- Read/write from files (e.g., `Encrypted.txt`, `war_and_peace.txt`)
- Small, beginner-friendly structure (separate classes for I/O and cipher logic)
